"""Anchor git-worktree isolation for managed terminal sessions (stdlib only).

v3 "Mission Control" (MASTER-PLAN §F, Implementation-Plan Wave 2). Each managed
terminal session runs in its OWN git worktree + branch so a planning session can
never dirty a running Foreman build's tree. This module owns the lifecycle:

- :func:`create_worktree` — resolve the project's repo (from
  ``rnd_registry.get_project(pid)["folder_path"]``), create a NEW branch and
  ``git worktree add`` it at a MANAGED, git-ignored location;
- :func:`remove_worktree` — ``git worktree remove`` with safety checks (only
  ever a path under the managed base; tolerate already-gone);
- :func:`reap_orphans` — sweep managed worktrees whose session id is not in the
  active set, and ``git worktree prune``.

**Where worktrees live + why:** under ``<data_dir>/.anchor/worktrees/<session_id>``
(``managed_base()``). This is OUTSIDE the project's tracked working tree, and the
``.anchor/.gitignore`` already excludes the per-project store; we additionally
ensure ``worktrees/`` is git-ignored there so a managed worktree is NEVER tracked
by the host repo. The base is overridable via the ``ANCHOR_WORKTREE_BASE`` env
var (and a ``base`` arg) so tests are hermetic — they point it at a tmp dir and
never create a worktree off the real build repo.

Robust by contract: a non-git folder, a missing path, or an already-removed
worktree must NOT crash — every entry point returns a clear status dict.

Stdlib ``subprocess`` only. No third-party imports.

    When the number of RETAINED-parked worktrees exceeds ``budget`` (env default

    evicted: :func:`remove_worktree` reclaims ONLY the git worktree, then
    :func:`_mark_evicted` stamps the record so EVERYTHING ELSE survives — the
    registry record (the tile persists), its chain/lineage, its cached summary,
    and its finalized cost record (an evicted session stays MEASURED; eviction
    never zeroes or un-measures anything). The evicted tile therefore renders as
    ``evicted-parked`` immediately, and its escalation opens a NEW seeded session
    on the SAME chain — never a reattach claim (NORTH-STAR-AMENDMENT eviction
    sub-contract).

    ``project_id`` is resolved PER session from the registry so a multi-project
    sweep still removes each worktree cleanly. Returns::

        {"evicted": [sid, ...], "kept": [sid, ...], "budget": N,
