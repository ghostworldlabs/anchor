description: Deal-flow and valuation engine â€” an exact-Decimal dependency-graph library (Python, in this skill folder) with ready templates (VC round comp, real-estate equity waterfall) that compiles synchronized Excel + Python models and grounded reports. Use for deal modeling, waterfalls, cap-table/round math, or when penny-exact Excel/Python tie-out matters.

# financial-analyst

You have a WORKING engine in this skill's folder â€” use it; never re-derive the math
ad hoc. Everything below runs on Python stdlib + `openpyxl` (see `requirements.txt`).

> **Tier definition (Heavy vs regular Â· always-cross-model Â· seat mapping):** canonical in `<path> Foundry\AGENTS.md` â†’ "Skill tiers". A `-Heavy` run uses top-frontier models on EVERY seat regardless of the base session (delegate the frontier seat to a frontier-pinned sub-agent if the base session isn't frontier); foundry skills are ALWAYS true cross-model. Do not re-define tiers locally.

## Scope gate (read first)

- **Simple finance question** (rule of thumb, one formula, "is this rental roughly a
  good deal?") â†’ just answer it in prose with the formula shown. Do NOT build models.
- **Deal model requested** (waterfall, round comp, "build me the model", anything
  where numbers must be defensible or handed to someone) â†’ use the engine below.
- The full tri-format output (Excel + standalone Python + agent-facing module) is
  produced only when the user wants deliverables, not for every calculation.

## The machinery (all in this folder)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `graph_engine.py` | Exact-`Decimal` dependency graph: `InputNode`/`FormulaNode`, memoized evaluation, cycle detection, cache invalidation on `set_input` |
| `agent_interface.py` | `FinancialAnalystAgent` facade â€” `load_template / set_input / get_value / evaluate / generate_report / compile_excel / compile_python` |
| `templates/vc_comp.py` | VC round comp: `pre_money_valuation`, `investment_amount` â†’ post-money, dilution, ownership splits |
| `templates/re_waterfall.py` | RE equity waterfall: `initial_equity`, LP/GP shares, two hurdles + 3-tier promote splits over per-period cash flows |
| `compiler_excel.py` / `compiler_python.py` | Compile the SAME graph to a live-formula Excel workbook / a standalone Python model |
| `report_generator.py` | Grounded markdown/PDF report + an LLM-facing prompt digest, all read off the evaluated graph |
| `tests/` | pytest suite (`python -m pytest tests/ -q` from this folder) â€” run it after any engine/template change |

## Quickstart

```python
# cwd = this skill folder (imports are folder-relative)
from agent_interface import FinancialAnalystAgent
a = FinancialAnalystAgent()
a.load_template("vc_comp", pre_money_valuation=8_000_000, investment_amount=2_000_000)
a.set_input("investment_amount", 2_500_000)   # graph invalidates + recomputes
values = a.evaluate()                          # every node, exact Decimal
report = a.generate_report("report.md")
a.compile_excel("model.xlsx")                  # live-formula workbook
a.compile_python("model.py")                   # standalone matching model
```

Templates: `"vc_comp"` and `"re_waterfall"` (see each template file's signature for
its inputs; `re_waterfall` takes `cash_flows=[...]` per period). **Honesty note
(2026-07-11): the shipped templates are STARTING POINTS at textbook granularity** â€”
`vc_comp` has no option-pool shuffle / SAFEs / share counts, `re_waterfall` is one
fixed 3-tier simple-pref structure with no catch-up or IRR/MOIC nodes. A real deal
usually means extending a template per "Extending" below â€” plan for that, don't
discover it mid-session.

## The tie-out rule (non-negotiable when deliverables are produced)

When you emit both Excel and Python outputs, they must agree **to the penny** â€” and
this is now MACHINE-CHECKED: call **`a.tie_out()`** (compiles the standalone Python,
executes it, compares EVERY leaf node against the live graph's exact Decimals) and
put its `line` ("tie-out: N nodes compared, max delta 0") in the deliverable. Never
hand-roll the comparison, and never ship deliverables when `ok` is false â€” a
divergence is a bug to fix.

## Grounding rule

Every quantitative claim in a report/answer must be a node value read off the
evaluated graph (or a directly-cited user input). No unverified qualitative
valuation claims ("attractive multiple", "market-standard terms") unless the user
supplied the benchmark.

## Extending

A new deal type = a new `templates/<name>.py` exposing `create_<name>_graph(**inputs)`
that returns a `Graph`, plus a branch in `agent_interface.load_template` and a pytest
file mirroring `tests/test_vc_comp.py`. Keep every formula a `FormulaNode` (never
compute outside the graph â€” that is what guarantees the Excel/Python tie-out).

> **â± STATUS UPDATES TO CHAT:** When running long phases in the background, you MUST arm a 10-minute cadence (`ScheduleWakeup` ~600s) and provide scheduled updates to the user in the LOCKED Status-table format â€” canonical definition in ONE place: user-global `AGENTS.md` â†’ "Long-run progress updates" (`[HH:MM]` header Â· Effort/Doing/Status/Tests/Blocker/Procs/**Journal** rows Â· ETA + To do footer). The **Journal** row (mandatory, `none` when empty) recaps everything journaled since the last tick â€” the SESSION composes it from this skill's `journal/`.

## Usage journal (sleep-loop feed â€” append after every REAL run)

At the end of any real (non-test) run of this skill, append ONE entry to
`journal/` in this skill folder as `NNNN-<slug>.md` (next number; APPEND-ONLY â€”
a correction is a new entry, never an edit). Keep it under ~15 lines, honest over
polished, with the 7 canonical fields (see
`planning/portfolio-program/src/journal.mjs`):

- `id`: NNNN-<slug>
- `skill`: <this skill>@<version or date>
- `situation`: the recurring situation class (the sleep loop's cluster key)
- `context`: the distinct project/session it ran in (cross-context corroboration key)
- `observation`: what was learned â€” the candidate-lesson signal
- `outcome`: the genuine result (worked | friction | failed | refused)
- `provenance`: genuine-execution | seeded (only genuine-execution corroborates)

No journal entries â†’ the sleep loop has nothing to learn from. This block is the
capture end of the Foundry's improvement loop.
