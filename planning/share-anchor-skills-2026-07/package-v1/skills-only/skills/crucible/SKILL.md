# Crucible

Crucible is the **planning brain** of John's skill trio: **researchPrime** (research)
→ **Crucible** (planning) → **Foreman** (build). It is a deliberately-invoked,
heavyweight planner that turns an intent — or a messy existing project — into a
**vetted, gold-standard, Foreman-ready implementation plan**, while **never
drifting** from the project's locked objective.

> **Tier definition (Heavy vs regular · always-cross-model · seat mapping):** canonical in `<path> Foundry\AGENTS.md` → "Skill tiers". A `-Heavy` run uses top-frontier models on EVERY seat regardless of the base session (delegate the frontier seat to a frontier-pinned sub-agent if the base session isn't frontier); foundry skills are ALWAYS true cross-model. Do not re-define tiers locally.

> **Status (2026-06-05): the engine is built and GREEN through Wave 11.** The
> three-stage pipeline, the Shark-Tank round engine, the Synthesizer + Judge, the
> two-gate convergence, researchPrime integration, the cross-model Enhanced mode +
> GitHub remote, the docs/VC layer, and the dogfood self-run + 5-gate
> productionization checklist all live in `bin/` and are exercised by
> `node --test test/`. The model-driven steps run through an injected `agent()`
> seam; the machine well-formedness gate is Foreman's real `locate-plan.mjs`,
> SPAWNED (never forked) so its exit code is forge-proof.

## What Crucible is / is NOT

- **Is:** a standalone skill that forges a plan through framing, brainstorming, and
  **Shark-Tank** refinement steered by a persistent **Deep-Think Synthesizer** and
  backed by researchPrime, then hands a Foreman-ready plan to the builder.
- **Reuses, never forks:** imports Foreman's `foreman-lib.mjs` (atomic checkpoints,
  budget, contract primitives), `git-hygiene.mjs`, and `makeAgentDriver` from
  `wave-workflow.js`; **spawns** `foreman/bin/locate-plan.mjs` as the well-formedness
  gate. Exactly one copy of each on disk.
- **Is NOT:** a lightweight everyday planner (that's Project-Manager), a code builder
  (that's Foreman), or an infinite-polishing machine.

## Two guiding principles

- **The inclusion test (the size rule):** every element must serve a North-Star
  criterion; growth that serves the objective is welcome — only non-serving bloat is
  cut or Grasscatched.
- **The Parable of the Oranges (real-intent foresight):** probe for the real goal,
  bring expertise, think 2–3 steps ahead, add justified value, show the receipt.

## The pipeline — three you-approve stages

1. **Stage 0 — Intake & Framing** → 🚦 the user **locks the North Star**. It opens with
   a **complexity triage** (`assessComplexity`): cheap intake signals (scope, novelty,
   stakes/irreversibility, unknowns) recommend a pipeline depth — **LITE** (single-pass,
   minimal/no Shark rounds for small/clear work), **FULL** (the full 3-stage + Shark-Tank
   machinery — the default), or **SPIKE-FIRST** (probe before planning when genuinely
   uncertain). Right-sizing is **your** judgment, so it **HALTs for you to confirm** and
   **defaults to FULL** when uncertain or when stakes are high — rigor is never silently
   downgraded. The triage only right-sizes *ceremony*: the North-Star lock, post-lock drift
   detection, the inclusion test, and full Shark-Tank rigor (when FULL) are unchanged in
   every band. Then greenfield Oranges framing, or a tiered brownfield ingest (T1
   inventory/dedupe → T2 reproduce-first + coverage → T3 delegate deep archaeology to
   researchPrime), with Confirmed/Inferred/Gap labels that gate. Drift detection begins
   **after** the lock.
2. **Stage 1 — Master Plan** → 🚦 the user **approves**. Oranges brainstorm
   (assumption-map → premortem → ideate), batch triage, a phased plan, then the
   Shark-Tank loop to convergence.
3. **Stage 2 — Implementation Plan** → 🚦 the user **approves** → the well-formedness
   gate → **Foreman handoff**. Wave decomposition with per-wave acceptance criteria
   (a one-line *done-when* + Given/When/Then for non-trivial waves), the Shark-Tank
   loop, then the emitted doc-trio + `foreman.config.json`.

**The Shark Tank** is the adversarial review round: 3 independent fresh-context Sharks
(Skeptic / Contrarian / Analyst), each prompted to refute, each embedding the North
Star + a rotated PM critique angle. **BLOCKER = ≥2 Sharks agree.** **The Synthesizer**
is a persistent Director that steers but never decides; **the Judge** decides
(cross-model when reachable, else a same-model fresh-context judge persona), and **the
user is the final convergence authority**.

## Substrate (two modes)

- **Default (subscription-only):** fresh-context Sharks + a same-model fresh-context
  Judge persona. Fully functional on the bare subscription.
- **Enhanced (API keys / CLIs present):** a cross-model Judge at the lock gate + a
  reasoning Synthesizer, selected by reasoning-strength + family diversity, with
  graceful degrade. Every run **stamps which model filled which role**.

## Files in this skill

**Engine (Node — ESM `.mjs`):**
- `bin/crucible-lib.mjs` — the contract layer: re-exports the imported Foreman
  primitives, the checkpoint superset (`newCrucibleCheckpoint`), the three-stage state
  machine + HALT-gate set, and the containment-safe managed-git context.
- `bin/agent.mjs` — the live `agent()` seam (`claude -p`), env-gated by
  `CRUCIBLE_AGENT_LIVE=1`, stubbable in tests.
- `bin/shark-tank.mjs` — the adversarial round engine (Sharks, cross-Shark finding
  identity, ≥2-agree BLOCKER, inclusion-test demotion, dry-round detection).
- `bin/synthesizer.mjs` / `bin/judge.mjs` — the Director (steers, never decides; the
  fresh-eyes cold pass + isolation oracle) and the context-free deciding Judge.
- `bin/gates.mjs` — the well-formedness gate (spawns `locate-plan.mjs`), the
  quality/convergence gate, and the post-lock tiered drift detector.
- `bin/research.mjs` — researchPrime integration (once up-front + cost-guarded per round).
- `bin/stage0.mjs` / `bin/stage1.mjs` / `bin/stage2.mjs` — the three stage protocols.
- `bin/band-profile.mjs` — LITE / SPIKE-FIRST / FULL ceremony profiles (cf-slick; depth → real path).
- `bin/enhanced.mjs` / `bin/remote.mjs` — the CROSS-FAMILY verification seam (builds the
  live role-routed agent: Gemini Sharks/Judge, Claude steering — the 5:1 split, via the
  shared `makeRoleRoutedAgent` + gemini-cli tier ladder) + the push-at-approval-gates
  GitHub remote (never auto-pushes).
- `bin/docs.mjs` — the living-doc + version-control layer.
- `bin/self-run.mjs` — the dogfood self-run (drives Stage 0→1→2, proves convergence +
  HALT/resume, emits a zero-HALT doc-trio) — also the runnable entrypoint.
- `bin/checklist.mjs` — the 5-gate Skill Productionization Checklist (the five
  North-Star criteria, made checkable) + the SKILL.md manifest checker.

**Tests:** `test/*.test.mjs`, auto-discovered by `test/index.mjs`. The gate is
`node --test test/`.

## How to invoke — the OPERATOR RUNBOOK (2026-07-11; a live session drives THIS, never an improvised protocol)

1. **Bind the live seam.** `CRUCIBLE_AGENT_LIVE=1`; build the cross-family agent via
   `buildLiveCrucibleAgent()` (`bin/enhanced.mjs` — Gemini Sharks/Judge, Claude steering, the 5:1
   split, Gemini cap 2). Pass its ROUTES into the loop (`runMasterPlanLoop({ ..., routes })`) so the
   Judge's stamp derives from where the judge role ACTUALLY dispatches (T7) — the default same-model
   Judge persona is the agy-down fallback, not the normal path.
2. **Stage 0** → `runStage0`/protocol: complexity triage HALTs for depth confirmation; frame; candidate
   North Star. **Gate ergonomics (John's locked preferences):**
   > **THE SHOW-THE-ARTIFACT RULE (locked by John, 2026-07-16): NEVER ask the user to approve/lock a
   > North Star they have not just been SHOWN. At the moment of the ask, print the ENTIRE candidate
   > North Star document — statement, success criteria, non-goals, risk taxonomy, foresight brief,
   > every section, verbatim — to the screen in the message body. A file pointer is NOT showing it.
   > A summary or paraphrase is NOT showing it. A clipped dialog preview is NOT showing it. If it was
   > shown earlier but anything intervened since, print it again in full with the ask. The same
   > discipline applies to every user-approval artifact (Stage-1 Master Plan, Stage-2 plan, amendment
   > diffs): the user approves what is on the screen, never what is in a file.**
   > **PROTOTYPE RULE (locked by John, 2026-07-18):** If the stage involves generating GUI prototypes or images, you MUST physically open them in the user's local browser (e.g. via an HTML wrapper and `Start-Process chrome`) BEFORE asking for their approval. Asking for approval before they have seen the prototypes on their screen is strictly forbidden.
   If the user asked for research, DELIVER IT BEFORE the lock ask; present decisions ONE AT A TIME,
   each with 30-second plain-English context and a recommendation first.
3. **Stage 1** → `runStage1({ agent, northStar, depth, routes, artifactsDir, statusLog, ... })` —
   brainstorm → triage → phased plan → Shark loop. On the round cap it HALTs WITH the best draft +
   open findings attached and persisted (T5) — review those, never restart from zero.
4. **Stage 2** → `runStage2({ agent, northStar, masterPlan, outputDir, depth, routes, statusLog, ... })`
   — decompose → loop → approval → emit + well-formedness gate → Foreman handoff. A cap HALT emits the
   unapproved doc-trio to `<outputDir>/_unapproved-cap-draft` (gated, clearly not the handoff).
5. **Dogfood deterministically** (no model, no billing): `node bin/self-run.mjs [outputDir]`.
6. **LITE / SPIKE / FULL bands (cf-slick 2026-07-22):** locked Stage-0 depth is resolved by
   `bin/band-profile.mjs` into a real ceremony profile — **not** label-only.
   - **LITE:** single-pass brainstorm (no full assumption→premortem→wide ideation), roundCap 1,
     2 concurrent Sharks, research-upfront off by default, low call budget. Still NS-embedded +
     inclusion test + user approval + locate-plan.
   - **SPIKE-FIRST:** probe required (`spikeProbe=`) before Stage-1 plan ceremony; then re-band.
   - **FULL:** full Oranges order, roundCap 5, 3 concurrent Sharks, effort-scoped caps + human-lockable.
   Explicit `roundCap` still wins over the profile default.

> **⏱ STATUS UPDATES TO CHAT — the launch pattern (2026-07-11 fix).** A Shark-Tank stage loop runs
> 20-40 min; a driving session that calls a stage FOREGROUND is frozen and CANNOT post updates — the
> silent-cadence bug. So when a session drives Crucible:
> 1. **Pass `statusLog: '<outputDir>/_crucible-status.log'`** into `runStage1`/`runStage2` — the loop
>    then writes the LOCKED Status table there at t=0, every ~10 min, and on stop (`bin/status-heartbeat.mjs`;
>    OFF when `statusLog` is omitted, so tests/dogfood stay silent). Crucible had NO emitter before this.
> 2. **Run the stage in the BACKGROUND** (Bash `run_in_background: true`), never a blocking foreground call.
> 3. **Arm the cadence at launch** (`ScheduleWakeup` ~600s or `/loop 10m`) and **each tick READ the tail
>    of `_crucible-status.log` (shell-free) and POST the latest status to chat in the LOCKED Status-table
>    format — canonical definition in ONE place: user-global `AGENTS.md` → "Long-run progress updates"
>    (`[HH:MM]` header · Effort/Doing/Status/Tests/Blocker/Procs/**Journal** rows · ETA + To do footer).
>    The **Journal** row (mandatory, `none` when empty) recaps everything journaled since the last tick —
>    the engine log is the data source; the SESSION composes the Journal row from `journal/`.**
> 4. **Stop** at the stage's user-approval HALT (the loop's `stop()` fires the final table automatically).
> The chat window is the PRIMARY channel; the log is the data source. Only a session reaches chat.

Every real run writes a `journal/runs/` training record (Skill Foundry AGENTS.md "Run capture").

## Usage journal (sleep-loop feed — append after every REAL run)

At the end of any real (non-test) run of this skill, append ONE entry to
`journal/` in this skill folder as `NNNN-<slug>.md` (next number; APPEND-ONLY —
a correction is a new entry, never an edit). Keep it under ~15 lines, honest over
polished, with the 7 canonical fields (see the Skill Foundry's
`planning/portfolio-program/src/journal.mjs`): id, skill, situation, context,
observation, outcome (worked | friction | failed | refused), provenance
(genuine-execution | seeded — only genuine-execution corroborates).
No journal entries → the sleep loop has nothing to learn from.
