# Jumper — the ideation and brainstorming engine

Jumper is the dedicated, high-order Ideation and Brainstorming Engine of the portfolio. It strictly composes the Gandalf deep-think skill to force divergent, structured, and vetted lateral thinking.

> **Tier definition (Heavy vs regular · stakes-gated cross-model · seat mapping) + invocation discipline
> (zero deliberation · the LOCKED global status table · run capture):** canonical in

> Jumper-Heavy runs the composed Gandalf at the MATCHING tier. Do not re-define or deliberate any of it.

## How to run (operator manual — a real invocation runs THE ENGINE, never an improvised pipeline)

```
node bin/jumper-run.mjs --problem "<the problem statement>" [--output out.json]
node bin/jumper-run.mjs --input problem.txt --fan-out 5 --retry-on-kill
node bin/jumper-run.mjs --problem "<statement>" --depth LITE
node bin/jumper-run.mjs --problem "<statement>" --depth FULL --fan-out <ideaRounds>
```

- **Default = PORTFOLIO mode (`fanOut 3`)**: 3 sphere-diversified candidates built in parallel
  (natural sciences / arts-humanities / rule systems …), each through Hesse→Dirac, judged by the
  kill-filter as a tournament → `survivors[]` ranked + GEP on the winner, `killLog[]` for the dead.
  `--fan-out 1` selects the legacy single-candidate pipeline; max 5.
- **`--depth` lock (LITE|SPIKE|FULL):** knobs from `@foundry/triage` only (`resolveJumperDepthKnobs`).
  When `--depth` is set and **`--fan-out` is omitted**, `fanOut` inherits live `ideaRounds` (one derivation).
- **P-CONFLICT (dual flags):** if both `--depth` and `--fan-out` are set, allow only when
  `--fan-out ===` live `ideaRounds`; mismatch → exit≠0 naming both values (`JumperDepthFanOutConflictHalt`),
  engine never starts. Recovery: omit `--fan-out` or pass the equal value.
- **killGates floor:** every depth keeps `killGates ≥ 3` (never thinned). Pre-run refuse below floor
  (`JumperKillGatesFloorHalt`); engine does not start.
- **Model seats are pre-decided** (invocation discipline): drafter/ideation = Claude; Gate 3 =
  Gemini via agy (`JUMPER_GATE3_DRIVER` overrides the driver, never the independence rule).
- **HALTs are honest outcomes, not bugs**: `JumperSelfReviewHalt` = Gate 3 resolved to the drafter
  family (fix the route); `JumperCrossFamilyDegradeHalt` = agy down (Jumper NEVER silently
  self-reviews — rerun when agy is back).
- Do NOT run the tripartite pipeline "by hand" in prose — an improvised run bypasses the
  commission ledger, the cross-family gate, and every honesty stamp. The engine or nothing.
- Every CLI run auto-writes a training record to `journal/runs/` (AGENTS.md "Run capture");
  long runs emit the LOCKED global status table every ~10 min unprompted.

## When to use
Trigger Jumper when the user wants to brainstorm, ideate, find out-of-the-box solutions, run creative pivots, map structural analogies, or resolve core system contradictions. Triggers: "brainstorm," "ideate," "help me pivot," "analogical transfer," "/jumper."

## North Star (LOCKED — verbatim)
Jumper is the dedicated, high-order Ideation and Brainstorming Engine of the portfolio. It strictly composes the Gandalf deep-think skill—using Gandalf's rigorous diagnosis as a foundation—to generate novel, out-of-the-box solutions, architecture extensions, and creative pivots. It leverages structured human ideation frameworks (e.g., TRIZ, SCAMPER, Analogical Transfer) to force divergent thinking. Crucially, it employs a 'generative-and-vetted' methodology: all generated ideas are immediately subjected to a ruthless kill-filter to ensure only structurally sound, highly promising concepts are presented to the user, completely eliminating LLM hallucination and shallow brainstorming.

## Core Architecture: The Tripartite Ideation Engine
Jumper operates as a high-order brainstorming engine that deeply composes Gandalf. To force divergent thinking without hallucination, it runs on a strictly phased Tripartite Engine:

*   **Phase 1: Peterson Query (Deconstruction & Probe)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses the **SCAMPER** framework to aggressively question the current state of the problem. It maps anomalous data, breaks the problem down into its fundamental assumptions, and identifies core contradictions.
    *   **Goal:** Explore the unknown and define the exact parameters of the chaos/problem space.
*   **Phase 2: Hesse Glass Bead Translation (Abstraction & Analogy)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses **Analogical Transfer** to lift the deconstructed problem out of its native domain. It maps the structural properties of the problem against a completely foreign domain (e.g., mapping a software architecture problem to Renaissance painting techniques or biological cell structures).
    *   **Goal:** Create a "universal symbolic language" connecting disparate disciplines across all human knowledge, art, and philosophy.
*   **Phase 3: Dirac Transfer (Symmetry & Resolution)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses **TRIZ** principles of invention to resolve the contradictions identified in Phase 1, using the analogical insights generated in Phase 2.
    *   **Goal:** Apply mathematical/structural elegance to map the abstract solution back to the concrete problem domain, ensuring the solution is beautiful, symmetrical, and highly effective.

## The Synthesizer Subagent (Intuition & Oversight)
To ensure the rigid frameworks (SCAMPER/TRIZ) don't miss obvious cross-domain connections or lateral leaps, a **Persistent Synthesizer Subagent** oversees all three phases.
*   **Role:** It leverages frontier-model intuition to catch blind spots, synthesize connections across the phases, and inject "steering flags" into the Tripartite Engine.
*   **The Oranges-Lens (Proactive Foresight):** The Synthesizer is explicitly guided by the *Parable of the Oranges*. It must exercise deeply contextual foresight—anticipating the true underlying needs, seeing 2-3 steps ahead, and finding high-value connections across domains rather than passively watching the frameworks execute.
*   **Constraint (The Trio Archetype):** It steers, but never decides. It cannot bypass the Tripartite Engine or the Kill-Filter. It strictly provides intuitive oversight to guarantee that a frontier model's native capacity for connection-making is fully utilized alongside the rigid frameworks.

## The 3-Gate Kill-Filter (Anti-Hallucination Guardrails)
Every generated idea—including any intuitive leaps suggested by the Synthesizer—must survive a ruthless three-gate kill-filter before being presented to the user. (Implementation: Gates 1+2 are judged in ONE model call with two independent verdicts — same-family cheap pre-filters, short-circuiting BEFORE the spend on Gate 3; Gate 3 is a separate CROSS-FAMILY adversarial call.)

*   **Gate 1: Existence Proof**
    *   *Test:* Is the concept theoretically possible? Does it violate the fundamental axioms or laws of its target domain?
*   **Gate 2: Glass Bead Syntax Test**
    *   *Test:* Does the analogical mapping hold logical/structural integrity, or is it merely a forced, shallow metaphor? (e.g., Does the biological analogy *actually* map to the software problem's constraints?)
*   **Gate 3: Dirac Structural Symmetry Test (Adversarial Gate)**
    *   *Test:* An independent adversarial subagent reviews the surviving concepts. It explicitly hunts for LLM hallucination, logical gaps, and asymmetry. Only ideas that the subagent verifies as structurally sound and practically applicable pass this gate.

## The Output: Grounding Execution Protocol
To avoid the "Ivory Tower" trap, Jumper will never output purely theoretical concepts. The final output must include a **Grounding Execution Protocol**: a concrete, step-by-step test plan to validate the idea in reality.
*   **For Empirical/Scientific Domains:** A formal experiment design, defined variables, and success metrics.
*   **For Software/Engineering:** A proof-of-concept architecture, unit test definitions, or a minimal viable implementation plan.
*   **For Art/Philosophy:** A concrete phenomenological demonstration, a rigorous logical proof, or a specific creative output.

> **⏱ STATUS UPDATES TO CHAT:** When running long phases in the background, you MUST arm a 10-minute cadence (`ScheduleWakeup` ~600s) and provide scheduled updates to the user in the LOCKED Status-table format — canonical definition in ONE place: user-global `AGENTS.md` → "Long-run progress updates" (`[HH:MM]` header · Effort/Doing/Status/Tests/Blocker/Procs/**Journal** rows · ETA + To do footer). The **Journal** row (mandatory, `none` when empty) recaps everything journaled since the last tick — the SESSION composes it from this skill's `journal/`.

## Usage journal (sleep-loop feed — append after every REAL run)

At the end of any real (non-test) run of this skill, append ONE entry to
`journal/` in this skill folder as `NNNN-<slug>.md` (next number; APPEND-ONLY —
a correction is a new entry, never an edit). Keep it under ~15 lines, honest over
polished, with the 7 canonical fields (see
`planning/portfolio-program/src/journal.mjs`):

- `id`: NNNN-<slug>
- `skill`: <this skill>@<version or date>
- `situation`: the recurring situation class (the sleep loop's cluster key)
- `context`: the distinct project/session it ran in (cross-context corroboration key)
- `observation`: what was learned — the candidate-lesson signal
- `outcome`: the genuine result (worked | friction | failed | refused)
- `provenance`: genuine-execution | seeded (only genuine-execution corroborates)

No journal entries → the sleep loop has nothing to learn from. This block is the
capture end of the Foundry's improvement loop.
