"""Anchor distribution builder + no-personal-data scanner (Wave 8, stdlib only).

Frozen design: MASTER-PLAN.md "## Architecture (frozen)" -> Distribution; C10
("Shareable, zero personal data"). Implementation plan: Wave 8.

What this does
==============
Builds a *publishable, data-free* export of the Anchor product into a staging
directory, then scans every staged file for personal data / secrets. The build
is **deny-by-default**: a file is staged ONLY if it matches an allow entry in
``dist_manifest.txt``. Everything else — task/project markdown, the R&D
registry JSON, ``.anchor/`` stores, ``logs/``, ``health_reports/``,
``foreman-checkpoint.json``, ``planning/``, ``_archive/`` — is excluded
automatically because it is simply not listed.

If the no-personal-data scan finds a hit in any staged file, ``build_distro``
raises :class:`PersonalDataError` naming the offending file(s) and what matched,
and (by default) tears down the staging dir so nothing leaks downstream.

The scan: real secrets fail, legitimate code passes
===================================================
The shipped product code legitimately contains the *identifier* ``ANCHOR_TOKEN``
(the env-var NAME) and may mention the Windows user-profile dir in a comment or
docstring example. The scan flags concrete personal-data **values and
secrets**, not bare identifiers. CRITICAL: this scanner stores **no** real PII
literal of its own — it detects PII by PATTERN, so it never has to embed (and
therefore never leaks) a real value.

- **Email (by pattern, not by stored value)**: any concrete user-at-host-dot-
  tld email literal in a staged file is flagged, EXCEPT a small hardcoded
  allowlist of known-safe, non-personal addresses that legitimately appear in
  the product (``anchor`` at ``localhost`` — the git identity used by
  ``effort_history``; the Anthropic ``noreply`` co-author address; and the
  RFC-2606 doc domains ``example.com`` / ``example.org`` / ``example.net``). A
  bare mention of the word "email" has no at-host-dot-tld shape and does not
  trip it. The real personal email is NOT stored anywhere in this file; it is
  caught purely by the generic regex.
- **User profile paths**: an *absolute Windows user-profile path* — a drive
  letter, then the Users dir, then a concrete account name, then a further path
  segment. The bare prefix (drive + Users dir, no account name + separator) does
  NOT trip it, so a code comment that merely mentions the Users dir passes,
  while a fully-qualified ``<drive>\\Users\\<account>\\<segment>`` fails. The
  allowlisted account ``example`` (``C:\\Users\\example\\...`` doc placeholder)
  is exempt.
- **Auth-token VALUE**: an actual secret value assigned to a token, in QUOTED
  or UNQUOTED assignment form and in JSON ``"key": "value"`` form, when the key
  is a secret/token-ish name (``ANCHOR_TOKEN``, ``token``, ``secret``,
  ``api_key``, ``password``, ``access_token``, ``auth_token``, ``bearer``):
  ``ANCHOR_TOKEN = "<value>"`` / ``"ANCHOR_TOKEN": "<value>"`` /
  ``ANCHOR_TOKEN=<value>``. The bare identifier ``ANCHOR_TOKEN`` with no value
  (env-var reference, ``"ANCHOR_TOKEN"`` as a dict KEY only, ``delenv(...)``)
  does NOT trip it, and placeholder values are exempt.
- **Concrete secret shapes (key-independent)**: AWS access key
  (``AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}``), JWT (``eyJ...\\.<b64>\\.<b64>``), ``sk-`` / ``ghp_`` /
  ``gho_`` token prefixes, and ``Bearer <token>``.
- **Generic high-entropy token (first-party files only)**: a long base64/hex
  run assigned to a secret-named key, or a standalone 40+ char high-entropy run.
  To avoid false positives on the **vendored, minified KaTeX** (275KB+ of
  third-party code full of high-entropy-looking runs, with documented
  PROVENANCE), the generic entropy heuristic is applied ONLY to first-party
  files and is SKIPPED for anything under ``vendor/``. The concrete-PII patterns
  (email, user path, registry/.anchor artifact, AWS/JWT/keyword-token) DO run
  over every staged file including ``vendor/``.
- **Registry / .anchor data artifact**: a staged file whose *content* is an
  R&D registry pointer-record / ``.anchor`` store payload (a JSON object with
  registry-shaped keys like ``folder_path`` + ``project`` ids, or a job
  pointer-record). Source code that merely constructs the string
  ``.anchor/projects/...`` does NOT trip it.

- **Third-party / native imports (stdlib-only enforcement)**: every staged
  first-party (non-``vendor/``, non-``tests/``) ``.py`` file is parsed with
  ``ast`` and each top-level import is checked. An import of a module that is
  NEITHER stdlib NOR a first-party Anchor module is an undeclared third-party /
  native dependency and FAILS the scan — UNLESS it is the single DECLARED,
  file-scoped exception: ``import winpty`` (the native ``pywinpty`` ConPTY
  backend) is allowed ONLY in ``pty_manager.py`` (lazy, terminal-subsystem-only).
  ``import winpty`` anywhere else, or ANY other native/third-party import (e.g.
  ``import numpy``) in any product file, is still refused. ``tests/`` are
  dev-only (pytest is a declared dev dependency) and ``vendor/`` is third-party
  by construction (documented PROVENANCE), so both are exempt from this rule.

No inline suppression marker exists. No shipped file embeds a real secret, so no
file needs (or can grant itself) an exemption — a leaking product file CANNOT
suppress its own detection.

Stdlib only (the scanner itself uses only ``ast``/``re``/``json`` etc.). Never
publishes/pushes anywhere — it builds a local export dir.

# ── README emission (AC3) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_README = """# Anchor — per-project R&D control surface

Anchor turns a task/project tracker into a per-project **R&D control surface**:
each code project is a folder, and a single dashboard drives the
**researchPrime → Crucible → Foreman** trio as durable, server-owned jobs with
versioned effort history, task↔project integration, and deliverable execution.

This is a **clean, data-free distribution** — it ships only the product code and
dependency-free assets. There is no personal task/project data, no R&D registry,
and no `.anchor/` store in this export; you start from an empty state.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (the shipped product is **Python standard library only** — with
  ONE optional, isolated exception: the v3 ConPTY terminal subsystem can use the
  native `pywinpty` package).
- **Optional terminal extra (`pywinpty`):** real in-browser ConPTY terminals
  (`pty_manager.py`) need `pywinpty` (`pip install .[terminal]`, Windows only).
  It is imported LAZILY and ONLY by the terminal subsystem — if absent, the
  terminal feature reports "real terminal unavailable" and the rest of Anchor is
  unaffected. The core import path stays stdlib-only.
- Optional system tools, invoked as subprocesses when present: `claude`
  (Claude Code), `git`, `latexmk` (for PDF reports).

## Run
```
python anchor_gui.py --no-browser      # local web server (default :8777)
```
Then open the dashboard in your browser.

## Develop / test
`pytest` is a dev-only dependency (not shipped at runtime):
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -v
```

## Layout
- `anchor_gui.py` — the dashboard server (main interface).
- `anchor.py` — CLI engine.
- `paths.py`, `rnd_registry.py`, `job_runner.py`, `gate_adapter.py`,
  `lanes.py`, `effort_history.py`, `report_viewer.py`, `dir_browser.py`,
  `anchor_healthcheck.py` — supporting modules.
- `vendor/katex/` — vendored KaTeX (math rendering for the report viewer).
- `dist_manifest.txt` — the deny-by-default shippable-file manifest.

See `LICENSE` if present, otherwise all rights reserved by the author.
