// Gandalf advisor — the REFUTATION-DISCIPLINE seam (Wave 4 / the NS4 honesty spine).
//
// NS4: a "vetted, value-adding suggestion" must survive an INDEPENDENT named-defeater
// refutation; only the REFUTED is dropped; nothing unverified is asserted as real. This
// module is the single seam that decides, deterministically:
//   • whether an elevation FIRES the refuter (value-if-true ≥ HIGH OR severity ≥ major, from
//     prereg-constants.json) — only those earn an INDEPENDENT named-defeater refuter;
//   • what counts as a NAMED CONCRETE DEFEATER vs a self-rated confidence word — the latter is
//     NOT a refutation, so the B-honesty canary FAILS / auto-downgrades it;
//   • the BOUNDED refuter budget R (=3): at the SEAM level assertRefuterBudget still throws
//     (the unit tripwire), but the LIVE path (runtime/live-refuter.mjs) pre-flights and FLOORS
//     excess — top-R refuted, the rest ship SPECULATIVE, each named (2026-08-25, John's ruling:
//     cost is a pre-flight conversation, never a mid-run wall); and
//   • the honest un-refuted floor: a finding that did NOT earn an independent refutation ships
//     SPECULATIVE carrying the "no independent refutation ran" stamp.
//
// Two honesty invariants are load-bearing here and are enforced at the deterministic gate
// (test/harness.mjs `assertHonestRefutation` + `assertRefutationSeam`; the budget HALT is a
// NAMED canary over `assertRefuterBudget`), label/semantic TRUTH staying the advisory layer's
// job (PRINCIPLE-D):
//   • NAMED DEFEATER, NOT A CONFIDENCE WORD. An elevation stamped above SPECULATIVE must carry
//     a named concrete defeater (`what_would_refute_it`) plus a `refutation_provenance` proving
//     an independent refuter ran. A self-rated confidence word ("very confident") is not a
//     refutation — B-honesty FAILS it (auto-downgrade to SPECULATIVE + stamp).
//   • BOUNDED BUDGET, NO SILENT DROP. The seam's assertRefuterBudget throws on excess (unit
//     tripwire); the live path FLOORS instead of halting — excess elevations ship SPECULATIVE
//     with a NAMED dispatch entry each (never silently taking the first R, never killing the run).
//
// PRINCIPLE-D: the live refuter `agent()` spawn is NOT in the gate. This seam mints the typed
// refutation ENVELOPE + the budget guard (the deterministic surface); actually dispatching the
// independent refuter to the trio `agent()` seam is the integration point the gate never runs.
