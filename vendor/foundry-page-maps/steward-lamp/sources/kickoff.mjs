/**
 * Gate 5 / Wave 3 - the CONVERSATION's kickoff law: what the existing free-talk flow
 * (engine/steward-conversation.mjs converse()) needs to synthesize, refine, show and
 * confirm ONE complete kickoff_proposal_v0 bundle on the one store
 * (<folder>/.ecgberht/kickoff/events.jsonl) without a form, a precondition prompt, or an
 * execution leak. The flow stays the flow John already has - free talk, quiet synthesis,
 * conversational refinement, one confirmation; what changes is what it synthesizes and
 * where that lands.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE - pure rules first, then the verbs the flow and the bridge call:
 *
 *   THE QUESTION CAP. At most KICKOFF_QUESTION_CAP (= 1) natural question per turn - the
 *   North Star's letter. The seat may write more; the engine delivers one and reports the
 *   rest as held, so a sparse opening never turns into a questionnaire.
 *
 *   ADAPTIVE DISCOVERY. One question per turn, with durable earlier answers.
 *   No exchange count forces a plan. An explicitly requested compact provisional
 *   proposal still uses the thin-bundle lane; ordinary discovery continues until
 *   the user's intent is sufficiently clear.
 *
 *   THE SILENT BOOTSTRAP. A new effort has no Face, no session envelope, no budget. None
 *   is a precondition for brainstorming and none is asked for: the Face is created ON
 *   confirmation, the envelope is materialized INSIDE the confirmation receipt (Wave 2),
 *   and until then the turn's spend rides the turn result. settleKickoffBootstrap names
 *   what is missing and that nothing was prompted.
 *
 *   THE LANE. A stood-up campaign (a Face already on disk) keeps the pre-Gate-5
 *   roadmap-ledger kickoff path the WH4 lane proves, BESIDE the store; a NEW effort (no
 *   Face) writes only the store, so during proposal and refinement the execution-leak
 *   sentinel sees nothing but .ecgberht/kickoff/ and the conversation log.
 *
 *   CONFIRM, SPOKEN. One hash-bound confirmation lands the receipt on the store (record
 *   hash AND rendered-prose hash), then the Wave 4 projection writer re-derives the
 *   read-model of record (.ecgberht/kickoff/projection.json + face.md) from that receipt,
 *   and the confirmed bundle is mirrored into the pre-Gate-5 projections the chamber
 *   paints today (roadmap plan entries, Face, Strip) - a mirror of the receipt, kept
 *   beside the store until the Wave 5 precedence work retires it.
 *
 * Failure states carry a status code AND user-visible text; missing, empty, ambiguous and
 * unknown are SEPARATE rows (kickoffConversationFailureTable). Stdlib only; nothing here
 * imports child_process. Source is ASCII on purpose (the repo's mojibake sweep).
