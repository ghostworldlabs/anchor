/**
 * THE CONVERSATIONAL STEWARD (2026-08-04).
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. The chamber compiled talk through ELEVEN closed acts matched by
 * regex (`dialogue.mjs` ACT_TABLE). Free-form speech matched none of them, so describing a
 * project — the one thing North Star SC1 says must produce a scaffolding — dead-ended on
 * "Ecgberht could not compile that to a closed act". The scaffolding path added later
 * (`deriveStagesFromDictation`) kept ones opening with a verb from a CLOSED LIST, which
 * returns 0 stages on John's real writing (his verbs are revise/keep/integrate/replace/
 * open/add/refresh). Widening the list just moves the failure to the next project.
 *
 * THE DESIGN ERROR IT FIXES. Two invariants drove the original build and BOTH ARE GOOD:
 *   E5 — chat is NEVER persisted (Strip receipts + roadmap events + Face are the sole ledger)
 *   the steward never invents — unknown is spoken as unknown; nothing written unconfirmed
 * The implementation conflated "don't persist chat" with "don't use a model to understand
 * what he said". Those are ORTHOGONAL. A model can hold the conversation and propose
 * structure while only confirmed receipts persist. This module is that separation.
 *
 * HOW THE CONVERSATION HOLDS TOGETHER ACROSS TURNS — without a chat ledger. The bridge is
 * spawned fresh per request and dies, so turn 2 would know nothing of turn 1. Three sources
 * rebuild the context each turn, and NONE of them is a persisted transcript:
 *   1. the open `scaffold_proposal` event on the spine — the scaffolding-so-far. It is
 *      already an admitted spine kind, so a re-proposal is normal history, not a restart.
 *   2. the ephemeral turns the CALLER holds in memory (browser page / test) and replays.
 *      They die with the session and are asserted never to reach an event.
 *   3. Face + roadmap projection + Strip — the campaign itself.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS DETERMINISTIC. The control verbs — carry on / park that / confirm commission /
 * switch seat — still compile through the closed act table. A model must NEVER decide to
 * spend or to write. Everything else John says goes to the seat.
 *
 * ENGINE LAW: nothing under engine/ may import child_process or call spawn*(). The seat
 * call arrives as an INJECTED `seatCall` hook; the real transport lives in
 * scripts/seat-call.mjs, outside engine/.
 *
 * Stdlib only. No host-absolute user homes in shipped strings.

// direct question id lacks a typed answer-reference. The BOUND (the
// deterministic question parse, the F7 ratification reader) is OWNED by the
// Anchor sibling's chamber_e1_bound.py — it is never re-implemented here.
// The caller (anchor_gui → seal-chamber-bridge --e1) computes the question
// ids + the ratification state THERE and injects them as `opts.e1`; this
// hook only validates typed answer-reference COVERAGE and refuses the close.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, by name: an absent / unratified / altered bound payload
// yields an `unenforceable` verdict carrying its named finding — never a
// silent clean pass — while the turn itself is NOT blocked (a steward turn
// is never blocked against a bound John has not signed; the F7 artifact's
// own law). Only a signed, enforceable bound may block.
