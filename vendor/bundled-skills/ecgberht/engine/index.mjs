/**
 * Ecgberht engine entrypoint.
 * W1: closed verbs + pack loaders.
 * W2: Face+Strip protocol, heal law, A1 discovery, strip-first rank.
 * W3: closed verb bodies + write-authority enforcement + harness canaries.
 * W4: dispatch table, LITE bias, structured receipts (override/depth/soft-vet).
 * W5 (legacy skill-plan): compose-only commission adapters + subscription seating.
 * Wave 5 (steward-handoff v3): decision records, G2/G3/G5/G6 spikes, cost
 *      model, deriveCommissionableSkills, SC6 feasibility verdict.
 * W6: verification pack, Grasscatcher ledger, Stage-2 freeze, canary pack.
 * TW1: Campaign Roadmap — append-only roadmap_events + derived projection.
 * TW2: Decision Packet / brief engine — Q1–Q12 deterministic retrieval,
 *      seen receipt delta anchor, read-only Anchor knowledge, precompute cache.
 * TW3: Commission propose/confirm + M2 job lifecycle receipts — jobs compose
 *      Anchor job_runner; queued→running→done|failed|orphaned|reaped;
 *      commission_abnormal receipt; commission_bind/status_flip via the
 *      Roadmap single writer. No in-process Foreman/Shark loops.
 * TW4: Dialogue compile layer (R2 §4.3 v1 act table; refuse-with-proposal;
 *      ephemeral dialogue store — no durable chat ledger) + seat hop
 *      (seat_hop receipt who/when/from→to; titlebar switcher wired to
 *      Anchor prefs claude/gemini/grok; non-event — no re-brief).
 * TW5: Seal chamber view model (wireframes v2.1 Screen 1) — goal bar ·
 *      Roadmap rail · ⏱ run block · steward-first conversation, composed
 *      from the closed verb bodies (CLI parity structural); rendered by the
 *      Anchor-dev docked overlay mount, never a v1 instrument card sheet.
 * TW6: High Seat view model (Screens 0+2) — raise queue (R2 §4.5, one raised
 *      at a time, ⚑ badge = queue length as the only ambient signal), spoken
 *      capacity balancing (annex A1/A3, override = receipt, no fake meters),
 *      Bring-it-up in-overlay hop (Option P path passport, cached packet) —
 *      plus the Decision Packet view (Screen 3): goal card always first,
 *      exactly one question, artifact display MVP (HTML inline best-effort,
 *      never a bare path), answers move the Roadmap via the single writer.
 * TW7: Standing up & honest states (Screen 4) — new-ground chamber (goal
 *      asked, never invented; Face+Strip created from templates on confirm
 *      ONLY), capacity-unknown hard-stop (spoken, exactly three honest
 *      options, no silent FULL, no meters), thin-evidence beat (honest
 *      unknown + constructive offer) — plus the TW7 canaries: junction
 *      realpath-before-prefix toward release freezes fails CI, and the
 *      second-task-DB canary keeps E5 the sole ledger.
 * TW8: Progressive-enhancement HARD GATE (voice / living animation /
 *      calendar-email open ONLY on TW5–TW6 spine green — structural probes
 *      over the shipped chambers — PLUS explicit literal-true config; any
 *      attempt before the gate refuses) + E7 recorded NOT built: parked
 *      Roadmap stub steps appended via the TW1 single writer, a refuse for
 *      any connector use, and the E7 not-built canary (connector marker +
 *      import/network call in engine sources is a red build — no OAuth code).
