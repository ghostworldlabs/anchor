// Gandalf runtime host — the LIVE cross-family REFUTER orchestration (Wave W3).
//
// THE INTEGRATION POINT the deterministic gate never runs (seam/refute.mjs PRINCIPLE-D): the Tier-1
// host (runtime/seam-pass.applySeamPass) can only ever floor every elevation to SPECULATIVE because
// no INDEPENDENT named-defeater refuter actually ran — there was no live `agent()` seam and no minter.
// This module is that missing seam: for each high-value elevation that FIRES the refuter, it dispatches
// a REAL cross-family refuter (a Gemini `agy -p` sub-agent, drafter family = Claude) and, per genuine
// refutation, MINTS a claim-bound commission into the SAME per-run ledger applySeamPass resolves against.
// The result: a genuinely cross-family-refuted, surviving elevation reaches GROUNDED with cross_model:true
// — DERIVED from the unforgeable ledger, never self-asserted.
//
// THE FIVE LOAD-BEARING INVARIANTS (build task W3):
//   1. ONE SHARED PER-RUN LEDGER. The minter mints into `ledger.mintCommission` and applySeamPass
//      resolves via the SAME `ledger.resolveCommission`. A split ledger ⇒ every mint is a false
//      negative (the gate can never authenticate an id it did not see minted). The host constructs
//      ONE `createCommissionLedger()` and threads its resolver into applySeamPass.
//   2. MINT/GATE IDENTITY MATCH. The commission's result_digest is CLAIM-BOUND (seam/refute.mjs
//      elevationIdentity = id + reasoning + what_would_refute_it). We mint on the EXACT elevation
//      object we place into the returned draft — the SAME object applySeamPass hands to the gate
//      (isCrossFamilyRefutation) BEFORE ensureItemKeys runs — so the two identities are byte-identical.
//   3. ROUTING GUARD (never self-review). The refuter role MUST resolve to a NON-drafter family. If it
//      would resolve to the drafter family (claude) or to routes.default=claude, we HALT — a drafter
//      grading its own draft earns no independent origin and can never cross the single-family ceiling.
//   4. HONEST-HALT. If the refuter errors / returns empty / agy is down (the W0 seam throws HaltError on
//      a non-attested / substituted rec), the elevation gets NO provenance ⇒ it stays SPECULATIVE and
//      cross_model is NOT lifted. `survived` must be an EXPLICIT refuter boolean, never defaulted true.
//   5. BOUNDED BUDGET. More firing elevations than the pre-registered budget R ⇒ HALT (assertRefuterBudget;
//      no silent drop of the excess).
//
// Stdlib + the shipped gandalf seams only. The trio role-routed agent is a LAZY dynamic import (live
// path only), so importing THIS module never loads the trio and never spawns a subprocess — the
// deterministic test injects a stub agent + a fixture ledger and exercises the full mint→gate path with
// zero live calls.
