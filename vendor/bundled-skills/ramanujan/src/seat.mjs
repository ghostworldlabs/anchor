// Cross-family SEAT resolution from the Anchor dashboard prefs (2026-09-04, John: "use the models that
// are selected in the Anchor dashboard").
//
// THE RULE (Skill Foundry AGENTS.md → "Skill tiers", UNIVERSAL SEATING LAW; amendment John 2026-09-04):
// the cross-family verifier seat is whichever configured family in Anchor's prefs (`review_family`
// first — the check seat — then `coding_family`) is NOT the author's own family. Gemini is used ONLY
// when a pref names it; it is never the default. When every configured family equals the author's,
// there is no cross-family seat: the caller stamps `cross_model:false` honestly (or takes the
// generator-independent ollama fallback) — a same-family check is never presented as cross-family.
//
// Prefs come from ONE place: the trio drivers' `loadModelFamilies` (Anchor data-dir settings.json →
// ~/.anchor/model_prefs.json → historical default), dynamic-imported from the pinned driver index so
// this skill never re-implements the read. Tests inject `loadModelFamilies` and never touch disk.
//
// A seat is only usable when tools.manifest.json carries a tool entry for that family (driver_ref +
// run_export + model) — the manifest is the pinned transport table; an unpinned family is reported,
// not guessed.
