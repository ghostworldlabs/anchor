// wave-workflow.js — Foreman Phase 1: the PRODUCTION driver seam for the
// one-wave engine (the model-driven {execute, review, fix} steps).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DESIGN FINDING (Phase 1, recorded in Foreman-Execution-Log.md as finding L):
//   The plan §2 says "single engine = the native Workflow tool." Building this
//   adapter surfaced that a Workflow-tool *script* has, by spec, "No filesystem
//   or Node.js API access." But the §5 orchestrator-run gate MUST (a) spawn the
//   discovered build+test command and (b) write a gate-artifact file that
//   sub-agents cannot write. Neither is possible inside a Workflow-tool script.
//   => The faithful realization of §5 keeps the ORCHESTRATOR + GATE + STATE in a
//      Node process (bin/wave-engine.mjs). The Workflow tool, if used at all, can
//      only drive the *model* steps (execute/review/fix) — never the gate. This
//      adapter therefore exposes those three steps behind an INJECTED `agent()`
//      function, so the Node orchestrator can call the model however it likes
//      (Workflow agent(), the Agent tool, or a scripted stand-in for tests).
//      Wiring a live agent end-to-end is Phase 2 work; Phase 1 ships the
//      deterministic orchestrator + the scripted driver, and this seam.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This file is plain Node (NOT a Workflow-tool script): it has no top-level
// `agent()`/`parallel()` globals and does no I/O itself. `makeAgentDriver`
// returns a driver with the exact shape bin/wave-engine.mjs expects, given an
// injected async `agent(prompt, opts)` whose return contract matches Workflow's
// `agent()` (text by default; the validated object when a `schema` is passed).
